## 1. Descripción general del producto

**Prompt 1:** 

As a CEO of a new startup, working as a expert CPO and Bussiness Analyst, we need to start builing a new startup technical project.

We are going to build a Gift Vouchers Platform, to interact and allow the users to buy and customize Gift Certificates to allow to send by email or print, and with QR codes to validate this uses.

Will have a platform to administrate those gift, to create new services to buy, to upload and customize new gift certificate templates, and we will love to create this platform being white labeled, to sell to different customers.

Must have an easy implementation to allow to connect with different websites as wordpress, custom sites and we will have our custom client website to offer also.

I need you to help me to analize this idea, to create a brief of the product requirement to start working and define the main flows that our platform must allow to the users.

We will use payments platforms as Mercado Pago for now, maybe later we will implement also Paypal and stripe to make it international. The platform will be in spanish for now but can be multilingual in the future. We will allow the users not only to sell gift certificates for an amount of money, also for products or services.

We dont know if there is any platform like this on the Argentinian Market that covers all this features, but we can make the research together and define the bussiness model.

So before we start, workin with this basic idea, do you have any doubts on the work we need to start doing or in the product idea?

## GTP o4 answer
This is an exciting project with a clear vision. Here are some initial questions and thoughts to refine the idea and ensure all aspects are covered:

Key Questions
User Roles:

What types of users will the platform have (e.g., administrators, customers, businesses offering vouchers)?
Will there be tiered permissions for different administrative users?
Gift Certificate Features:

Should certificates be customizable by end-users, including messages, designs, or branding?
Will you allow expiration dates or usage restrictions on vouchers (e.g., valid only on weekdays)?
Should gift certificates be transferable between users?
White Labeling:

How customizable should the platform be for customers (e.g., branding, domain integration)?
Will you offer API access for customers to embed features in their websites?
Validation and Tracking:

What mechanisms will be used to validate QR codes (e.g., scanning through a mobile app)?
Will businesses have dashboards to track redeemed certificates?
Marketplace:

Will you allow users to browse and purchase certificates from multiple businesses on the same platform?
Integrations:

What CMS platforms should be prioritized for integration?
Should the platform offer a widget or plugin for easy embedding on external sites?
Business Model:

Will the revenue model be subscription-based, transaction-based, or a combination?
Will there be additional fees for white-labeling or premium features?
Compliance:

Are there specific regulations in Argentina or other target markets for digital vouchers?
Scalability:

How will you ensure the platform can scale as more businesses and users join?
Competitor Analysis:

Have you identified direct competitors in Argentina or globally? If not, would you like to prioritize researching this?
Proposed Next Steps
Market Research:

Investigate existing platforms to identify gaps and potential differentiation.
Requirements Gathering:

Define detailed user personas and workflows for each role.
Specify the minimum viable features (MVP) and optional features for later phases.
Technical Stack Definition:

Decide on the backend and frontend technologies for scalability.
Ensure APIs for payment integrations and CMS compatibility.
Flow Diagrams:

Map out the core flows, such as voucher creation, customization, purchase, validation, and redemption.
Documentation:

Create a high-level product requirements document (PRD).
Prepare initial wireframes for key user interactions.
Let me know if you'd like me to start with any specific task, such as competitor analysis, flow mapping, or drafting the PRD.

## My Answer

Amazing Questions, lets start answering.

1. We will have administrators (will see the entire platform), store managers (will see and manage their own services, products, sells and all their stuff) and customers, buying and using the platform to manage their buys.

Yes will be tiered permissions for different users.

2. Yes, they should be customizable, including messages, the person who sent, the person who recieves, a message, different vouchers design to use.

The vouchers will have expiration dates, and use restrictions, those will be or maybe asosicated to the store or maybe to the service or product.

The voucher cannot be transfered, can be used by the one who buy or by the one who has recieved the gift voucher.

3. Im not sure right now, i want to make it white label to resell, help me with this point.

Yes we need to offer api access, and documentation, so it can be used for any client that wants to.

4. We will use QR and Custom alphanumeric unic key codes.
Yes the bussiness has to have dashboards to track all, orders, sells, uses, services, products.

5. Will be good in the next MVP, but yes.

6. We need to focus on our platform thinking about integtations, i think Wordpress must be one and then custom sites, but im open to hear new ideas or propositions.

Wes maybe we can create widgets for those platforms on the future.

7. I dont know for sure, maybe a combination, we need to think how to make it rentable, for now is only an idea. If you can help me we can analize competitons and make a business plan.

8. No that i know

9. I dont know, can you help me to figure out?

10. i dont, can you help me to figure out this? Is a priority

Do you have any aditional questions? or we can traspass those answers to make the requierement more clear.

**Prompt 2:**

Ok lets start with the Business Model Development, all the platforms that we have seen are marketplaces and only allow the user to gift vouchers with money amount, we need to create something more custom for the small and for services as masagges or spa days.

As an expert bussiness analyst, can Analyze the pricing and revenue models of competitors to inform the development of a competitive and sustainable business model.

**Prompt 3:**

OK good i think that we have a lot of definition on the business model, we will go deeper in the future to finish those strategies.

Now lets focus on being an expert product and business analyst and start building our Product Requirements Document. Lets start with a draft of everything we have discussed.

## 2. Arquitectura del Sistema

### **2.1. Diagrama de arquitectura:**

**Prompt 1:**
now based on this stack, as an expert software architect we need to continue and define the main entities and relations for our System.

We need to create the Mermaid Diagram for the entire system architecture, defining each entity and their fields with their correct definition and relations.

Do you have questions? Lets start defining together.

## CHAT GPT 4o answer:
Step 1: Identifying the Main Entities
Based on the PRD and MVP features, we will have the following entities:

User

Store Managers, Administrators, Customers
Role-based permissions
Voucher

Created by Store Managers
Assigned to specific customers
Contains expiration dates, QR codes, and unique alphanumeric keys
Transaction

Tracks payments and voucher purchases
Links customers, vouchers, and payment status
Store

Each store has Store Managers
Stores create vouchers for their products/services
Product/Service

Vouchers are associated with a product or service
Redemption

Stores records of voucher redemptions
Links to the Store and Customer

---

Key Relationships in the System
Users & Roles

A User can be an Administrator, Store Manager, or Customer.
Admins manage stores and oversee transactions.
Store Managers own Stores and create Vouchers.
Customers purchase Vouchers and redeem them.
Stores & Products

A Store offers multiple Products/Services.
Vouchers are linked to specific Products.
Transactions & Vouchers

Customers buy Vouchers, generating Transactions.
Transactions are completed through MercadoPago, PayPal, or Stripe.
Voucher Redemption

Customers redeem Vouchers at Stores.
Redemptions track usage and status.

**Prompt 2:**
Ok lets change trasaction for Orders, because they are orders of ayment.
lets add to the order an object for payment that will have payment id, payment status, payment email and some other mercado pago apk needs.

lets update the redeption word, is not good, propose others please.

remember that the user can see their own orders or buys on the profile page, lets add some fields for that. 

and make the diagram correct because is not right, is failing, have code issues

--

GPT 4o Answer:

Great updates! I'll address each of your points:

Rename Transaction to Order and modify its structure to include a paymentDetails object containing:

paymentId
paymentStatus
paymentEmail
Other necessary MercadoPago details.
Rename Redemption to something more meaningful. Here are a few alternatives:

VoucherUsage
VoucherClaim
VoucherValidation
VoucherRedemption
UsageLog
I suggest VoucherUsage as it clearly represents the act of using a voucher.

Ensure the User can see their Orders and add relevant fields.

Fix syntax issues in the diagram to ensure it renders correctly.
